SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches for 62 million dollars on its official website, which is significantly lower than other providers who charge upwards of 165 million dollars. A significant reason for this cost reduction is SpaceX's ability to reuse the rocket's first stage. By determining the success of the first stage landing, we can estimate the overall launch cost. This analysis is crucial for potential competitors who might want to offer competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches. In this study, we will gather and preprocess data from SpaceX's Rest API, ensuring it is in the appropriate format.
